# NumPy Library
NumPy is a Python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’.It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object.

Numpy is a Data Analysis Library which helps in creating vectors and multi-dimensional arrays i.e matrices along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Topics Covered-

1. Vectors and insepecting it
2. Matrices and inspecting it
3. Vector and Matrices Creating Techniques
4. Slicing an array- Vectors and Matrices
5. Arithmetic Operations within an Array- Vectors and Matrices
6. Unary Operators
7. Binary Operators

I have also given Numpy Cheat Sheet for the reference along with my notes for the better understanding.

Happy Learning!
